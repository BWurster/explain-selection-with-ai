# Obsidian AI Expander Plugin

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

This plugin provides an additional element to the editor context menu that will prompt an [OpenAI Chat Completion API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/chat-completions-api)-compatible AI endpoint to elaborate on the selected text in the surrounding context.

In order to set up the plugin for use, all you need is the API-endpoint URL and an API key. Fill out these fields in settings to begin making requests.

Note: if you are using an OpenAI endpoint, using the enpoint name such as `gpt-3.5-turbo` or `gpt-4o` is sufficient instead of using the full URL.
